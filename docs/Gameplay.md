Game-play Ideas
===============

Offline user protection vs. online user aggravation
---------------------------------------------------

This is an issue due to users having an impact on game geography. Two possible solutions are:

- Take user-owned solar systems offline.
- Run user as NPC.

Expansion
---------

Users could be forced to expand by making planet resources finite.

Player vs. Environment (PVE)
----------------------------

Introduce NPC species.

Safe area
---------

Users cannot be completely wiped-out. Private galaxies?

User Experience Caps
--------------------

How to ensure fair game-play between users. Could be circumvented to some degree by spawning users nearby other new users?
